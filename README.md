# Prework Memory Game

This is code from the General Assembly Prework. Some things are updated to be more relevant (namely **NO FLOATS** and **NO ALERTS**).

This code also features some additional bonuses:
* Removes event listeners from the cards when game ends (ln. 78-83)
* Replaces alerts with a message `<div>` where a `<p>` tag is programatically generated with win or lose content (ln. 23-33)
* Adds a 'Reset' button which resets the board (_board reset:_ ln. 46-64, _button listener:_ ln. 94)
